# CoralCollective - Visualizing Small Actions as Ecosystem Growth ü™∏

> **"Just as coral reefs thrive when many tiny organisms contribute, your small sustainable actions build the future world."**

CoralCollective transforms individual sustainable actions into a thriving digital coral ecosystem. Watch your reef grow from bleached and lifeless to vibrant and teeming with life as you complete daily eco-friendly tasks.

## üåä The Vision

### Nature Inspiration: Coral Reef Symbiosis
Real coral reefs are built through the collective efforts of countless tiny organisms working together. Each polyp, each algae, each small fish contributes to a thriving ecosystem that supports incredible biodiversity. CoralCollective mirrors this natural process - your individual actions combine with others to create meaningful environmental impact.

### Your Actions Build the Future World
Every sustainable choice you make contributes to:
- **Coral Recovery**: From bleached white to vibrant colors
- **Marine Life Return**: Dead fish transform into living, swimming ecosystems  
- **Collective Impact**: Individual actions aggregate into global change
- **Visual Progress**: Gorgeous reef visualization shows your growing impact

## ü™∏ How It Works

### 1. **Daily Sustainable Tasks**
Complete eco-friendly actions that matter:
- üö¥ Use alternative transportation
- ‚ôªÔ∏è Recycle and reduce waste
- üå± Choose sustainable products

### 2. **Coral Ecosystem Growth**
Your actions directly impact your coral reef:
- **0-25% Health**: Bleached, dead coral with floating dead fish ‚ò†Ô∏è
- **25-50% Health**: Coral begins to recover, showing hints of color
- **50-75% Health**: Living fish return, coral gains vibrant hues üê†
- **75-100% Health**: Thriving ecosystem with colorful coral and active marine life üå∫

### 3. **Collective Impact**
Connect with others to see how individual actions create:
- **Community Reefs**: Shared ecosystems that grow together
- **Global Impact**: Aggregate carbon savings and environmental benefits
